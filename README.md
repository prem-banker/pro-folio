# Pro-folio

**Pro-folio** is an open-source developer portfolio website designed to showcase your skills, projects, and experience in a visually appealing and interactive manner similar to a VSCode window. The website is built using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, with integration for sending emails via EmailJS.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and web with a developer-themed layout.
- **Customizable Content**: Easily update your information through `user.json` and `meta.json`.
- **SEO Optimized**: Pre-configured meta tags and Open Graph (OG) images for improved search engine visibility.

## Installation

To set up the portfolio on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prem-banker/pro-folio.git
   cd pro-folio
   ```

2) **Install deps:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **EmailJS Setup:**

- Update the .env.local file with your EmailJS SERVICE_ID, TEMPLATE_ID, and PUBLIC_KEY

4. **Customise your information**

- Update user.json with your personal details, including your name, bio, and social links.
- Update meta.json with information about your tech stack.

5. **Run in local and make necessary changes**

## Future enhancements

- Automation: Streamlining the setup process and reducing manual configurations.
