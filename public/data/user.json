My main background and projects are in Software Development and Artificial Intelligence, which I had the pleasure of working on during my studies and at my work. I love to work in teams and make meaningful contributions with like-minded people.\n\nWhen I’m not coding, you’ll find me playing soccer (which should definitely be called football) or watching YouTube.\n\nFeel free to drop me a message if you want to chat about tech, football, or the best YouTube rabbit holes—I'm always up for a good conversation!",
